# MyTwoCents

# What it does
The algorithm takes into account a number of different parameters including your after-tax income, how often you get paid, how much you have in savings and your recent purchase history. When you click this chrome extension on the product page of something you want to buy, the extension will output a score. This score is between one and ten and determines how financially responsible it would be to purchase the certain product. A score of 9 would mean that the product would be well within your means to purchase and a score of 3 would mean the opposite.

# How we built it
The front end web page was built using HTML and CSS and the extension itself was built using javascript. The back end was built using Django with the Surveymonkey API, XE API, and the QuickBooks API. The algorithm was built in python using machine learning.
